# Service Providers

This page is written for **agents** to understand what service providers are, how they relate to tickets, and how agents interact with them throughout the lifecycle of a ticket.

Service providers are a core part of the 24HR Truck ecosystem. While agents manage tickets and coordination, service providers are the ones who physically deliver the service on the ground.

This page explains the relationship between agents, service providers, clients, and tickets in a clear and practical way.

## What Is a Service Provider?

A service provider is a business or individual that delivers roadside or vehicle-related services. This can include towing companies, mechanics, roadside repair specialists, or other vehicle assistance providers.

Service providers do not create tickets themselves. They operate **within tickets** that have already been created by agents or AI agents. Their role begins once a ticket requires physical service to be delivered.

A service provider may:
- Be linked to one or multiple clients
- Act as a primary provider, secondary provider, or both
- Provide one or many types of services
- Operate across different locations or regions

---

## How Service Providers Relate to Tickets

Every service provider interaction happens **inside a ticket**.

Once a ticket is created and contains all required information (policy or self-pay, breakdown reason, location, vehicle details, and timing), a service provider can be assigned.

The service provider is responsible for:
- Providing an estimated time of arrival (ETA)
- Arriving at the breakdown location
- Performing the required service
- Notifying the system when service milestones are reached
- Confirming when the service is completed

Throughout this process, the ticket status changes to reflect the provider’s progress.

---

## How Agents and Service Providers Work Together

Agents do not manually call service providers.  
All provider communication (ETA requests, availability, and cost collection) is handled by the system.

The agent’s role is **decision-making and coordination**, not outreach.

Agents:
- Review provider ETAs and costs collected by the system
- Choose the most efficient provider based on time and cost
- Assign the selected provider to the ticket
- Monitor ticket status updates
- Handle delays, confirmations, and follow-ups
- Confirm completion and payment flow

Service providers:
- Respond to system requests
- Travel to the provided location
- Perform the service
- Send status updates back through the system

This separation ensures speed, consistency, and traceability.

---

## What Agents Can Do to a Service Provider Within a Ticket

Within a ticket, agents can:
- Assign a service provider
- Change the assigned service provider if needed
- Update ETAs when delays occur
- Change ticket status based on provider progress
- Confirm arrival and completion
- Validate additional services performed
- Finalize the ticket after payment is settled

Agents **do not** negotiate costs manually or chase providers directly unless explicitly required by an exception workflow.

---

## Ticket Statuses Related to Service Providers

As a service provider progresses through a ticket, agents must ensure the ticket status reflects reality.

Common service-provider-related statuses include:

- **SP Assigned** – A service provider has been selected and assigned  
- **SP Delayed** – The provider has not arrived within the agreed ETA  
- **SP Arrived** – The provider has arrived at the breakdown location  
- **SP Completed** – The provider has completed the service  

Accurate status updates are critical for client visibility, reporting, and payment flow.

## Primary Service Providers

Primary service providers are service providers that are directly associated with a client.

A service provider can become a **primary provider** in two ways:

### 1. Created on the Client’s Service Provider Page
Agents can manually create and link a service provider directly under a client’s account. Once created, that provider becomes a primary provider for that client.

### 2. Assigned Through a Contract
Some clients have contractual agreements that automatically designate certain service providers as primary providers. In this case, the provider is linked through the contract rather than manual creation.

Primary service providers typically:
- Have predefined or fixed pricing
- Are preferred for that client’s tickets
- Are considered first when assigning a provider

A primary provider can still serve **multiple clients**.

---

## Secondary Service Providers

Secondary service providers are general providers available within the system.

They:
- Are not tied exclusively to a specific client
- Are used when no primary provider is available
- May have variable pricing
- Provide ETAs and costs dynamically

Secondary providers act as a flexible network that ensures coverage even when primary providers are unavailable.

A service provider can be:
- Secondary for one client
- Primary for another
- Secondary for multiple clients simultaneously

---

## Creating a Service Provider as an Agent

Agents are allowed to create service providers within the system.

This is typically done when:
- A client requests a specific provider
- A driver recommends a provider
- A new provider needs to be onboarded for a client

When creating a service provider, the following information is required:

- **Business Name** (required)
- **Business Phone Number** (required)
- **Business Email Address** (required)
- **Services Provided** (optional)

Services provided can be left blank if unknown or unnecessary. All other fields are required to ensure proper communication and traceability.

---

## International Address Considerations

Service providers and breakdown locations may exist in any region.

Addresses should be recorded in a **full international format**, including:
- Street or road name
- City or locality
- State, province, or region (if applicable)
- Postal or ZIP code (if available)
- Country

Agents should never assume a default country or address format. Accuracy here directly impacts dispatch success.

---

## Summary

Service providers are execution partners within the 24HR Truck system.

Agents:
- Create and manage tickets
- Assign and monitor service providers
- Make operational decisions
- Ensure accurate status updates and payment flow

Service providers:
- Deliver the physical service
- Update progress through the system
- Complete the job and confirm execution

Understanding this relationship allows agents to move faster, reduce errors, and ensure smooth ticket resolution.
