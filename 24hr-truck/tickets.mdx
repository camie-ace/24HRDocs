# Ticket Process

In this section, we dive deep into the entire lifecycle of a ticket within the 24HR Truck system. From creation to completion, agents will learn how to handle each step effectively.

## What is a Ticket?

A ticket in the 24HR Truck system represents a single incident involving a broken-down vehicle that requires assistance. It is the central record of a specific roadside issue, including all details about the driver, vehicle, and required services.

## Ways to Create a Ticket

Tickets can be created by human agents or AI agents. Regardless of the method, the process ensures that each ticket is valid and tied to the correct client.

### Step One: Policy Validation

For human agents, the first step is to validate whether the driver has provided a policy and confirm the vehicle details. If a policy is provided, it must be validated before proceeding. If no policy is provided, the ticket proceeds as a self-pay case.

For AI agents, if no policy is provided, the system defaults to self-pay. Once the policy is validated or the self-pay option is confirmed, this step is complete.

### Step Two: Collecting Driver Information and Breakdown Details

Next, agents collect the driver’s cell phone number, the reason for the breakdown, and an issue description. This information is gathered from the driver’s description and the conversation notes.

### Step Three: Collecting Breakdown Location and Determining Coverage

Agents then record the exact location where the vehicle is stranded and categorize the vehicle’s weight class. They also confirm who covers the payment (client, driver, or both).

### Step Four: Setting the Tow Destination (If Applicable)

If the vehicle needs to be towed, the agent records the tow destination, such as a repair shop or another location.

### Step Five: Scheduling and Special Instructions

Agents schedule the service based on the client’s preferred time and add any special instructions provided by the client.

## Modifying a Ticket

After a ticket is created, agents may need to make modifications. This includes assigning a service provider, handling delays, and confirming the provider’s arrival.

### Assigning a Service Provider

The system contacts providers to gather ETAs and costs. The agent selects the best provider and assigns them to the ticket, updating the status to **“SP Assigned.”**

### Handling Provider Delays

If a provider is delayed, the agent reschedules the ETA and updates the status to **“SP Delayed.”**

### Confirming Service Provider Arrival

When the provider arrives, the status is updated to **“SP Arrived.”** The agent can confirm this with the driver if needed.

### Service Provider Completed

When the provider completes the service, the status is updated to **“SP Completed.”** The agent confirms with the driver that everything is done and any additional services are noted.

## Completing a Ticket

### Payment and Invoice

If the driver is responsible for payment, they receive a payment link via their phone number. If the client is covering payment, an invoice is sent to the client. Once all payments are confirmed, the ticket is updated to **“Completed.”**

### Closing the Ticket

With payment confirmed and the service complete, the ticket is closed, marking the end of the process.
